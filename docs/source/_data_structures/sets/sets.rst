Python Data Structures: Sets
============================

Python sets are:

    * Unordered, non indexable, distinct immutable (hashable) elements
    * Mutable themselves (set), however a :class:`frozenset` is available for immutability
    * Sets cannot contain other sets as they are not hashable, they can contain :class:`frozenset`'s
